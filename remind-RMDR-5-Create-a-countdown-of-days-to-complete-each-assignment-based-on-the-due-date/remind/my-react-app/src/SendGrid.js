        text:'Hello! Hope your summer has been off to a great start! Here are some logistics around resolving grades for CS10 during this summer semester. If youre receiving this email, then you either received an incomplete in CS10, or noted that youll continue working on CS10 and asked that we update your current grade once youre done (i.e., you picked Option-B in your end-of-semester survey.) Please note that extension requests for incompletes have not yet been processed but will be processed most likely in late June. If you are planning on submitting work or taking exams this summer, you must fill out the Continuing Work in Summer 2024 Form , so we can add you to the Gradescope, Ed Discussion, and PrairieLearn. The submission instructions for assignments (labs, projects, RQs, Lecture Quizzes) are the same as in Sp23: To submit projects 1-4, Reading Quizzes, and Lecture Quizzes (if applicable in your semester) students will use whichever Gradescope instance from the semester they originally took the course. To submit project 5 and complete exams, students will use the CS10 Summer 2024 PrairieLearn instance. If your original semester used an autograder for labs, then you can submit to the original Gradescope instance for credit on labs. However, if your original semester did NOT contains auotograders for labs, you will need to submit the labs to the Google Form (more info below). You should upload a single .xml / .py file with ALL the exercises in the lab and a text document containing responses to ALL checkoff questions in the form. Please note, each semester - and especially in the summer semesters, the content and assignments change. So, new assignments may be added to a particular semester, and some assignments might be removed. The number (such as Lab 2, Lab 3, etc.) may not line up with your original semester. You are ONLY expected to work on the assignments that were required in your semester. To find more information about assignments or syllabus items of your semester, you can go to that semesters website: cs10.org/SEMESTER. For example, if you took the course in Spring 2023, you would go to cs10.org/su23. The process for taking exams will be different: This Summer, we will offer an in-person Midterm and an In-person Final. There will also be an in-person Midterm retake and an in-person midterm Final. You are eligible to take BOTH the original exam and the retakes this semester only. You will be able to take these exams to clobber your score on the No-Snap! portion AND the With-Snap! / Python of your Midterm and Postterm respectively. A total percentage score clobber will be implemented (and not a question-wise clobber) since the exams will have a different format and questions wont align. In other words, youll have to retake the entire exam and score better overall, in order to clobber your grade. In addition to submitting your projects and reading quizzes on Gradescope / PrairieLearn, you will ALSO have to submit ALL assignments (labs, projects, RQs) to the CS10 Submitting Work for Incomplete / Continuing Students Form. If you retake an exam, you must indicate that you did so by filling out the form. This means that you will need to submit a form entry for every assignment/exam you would like us to regrade. You only need to submit this form if you are content with the new grade you got on an assignment. For example, if you took the midterm and got an "F" grade, and you are not happy with that score - and you would like us to NOT count it. Then, you would NOT fill out a form submission for that midterm. Our in-person exams are TENTATIVE and subject to change. Here is the current schedule: 1. The Midterm will be held on Friday, July 12th 2024 (well let you know what the final time is in an email closer to the exam). 2. The Midterm RETAKE will be held on Friday, July 19th 2024 (well let you know what the final time is in an email closer to the exam). 3. The Final will be held on Wednesday, August 7th 2024 (well let you know what the final time is in an email closer to the exam). 4. The Final RETAKE will be held on Friday, August 9th 2024 (well let you know what the final time is in an email closer to the exam). If youd like to take any of the exams this summer, youll have to fill out the Incomplete Request to Take Exams Form by Wednesday, July 3rd, at 2359 hrs, so we can ensure we have enough seating. Well send you another email with exam instructions closer to the exam if you submit the form by the deadline. After you take the exams, you must indicate completion in the Submitting Work for Incomplete / Continuing Students Form. Using Su24 resources: You are able (and encouraged) to go to Office Hours! To get information on your grade, you will need to attend any Office Hour labeled, "Support Office Hours", which you can find on the schedule portion of the website. This semester, you can also attend lecture, lab, discussion, and any project parties or midterm review sessions. Extending Incomplete: In case you did not get our email about extending your Incomplete, if you have one, please fill out this form ASAP: CS10 Incomplete EXTENSION Request. Unsubscribing from emails: If you have already resolved your grade or are done working, please feel free to unsubscribe from out emails using the CS10 Incomplete UNSUBSCRIBE Form. I, Victoria Phelps, will be your main point of contact this semester. If you have any other questions, please let me know! Best, Victoria Phelps',
